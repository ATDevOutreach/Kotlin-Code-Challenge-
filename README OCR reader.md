# OCR Reader
An Android Application that will allow you to identify the text seen from your phone camera, and also be able to speak the text that's identified, using Google's Mobile Vision Text API for Android
There are a lot of focus on normal people when it comes to tech and little attention is given to the physically challenged people. Imagine if you were blind for two minutes? Imagine the limitations? How do you feel? According to estimates from world Health Organization (WHO), there about 285million people who are visually impaired worldwide, Vision loss in Nigeria is estimated to be 1.13million individuals aged 40years are currently blind in Nigeria. Blindness can cause significant social challenges, typically because there are activities in which blind people can not easily participate. One of the areas of limitations which this app is solving is the area of character recognition(Text.) This growth opens a development space for practical applications geared towards the development of an Optical Character Recognition Reader which will enable blind people to be able to recognise text (read)with the aid of the Mobile Vision Text API and it reads it out with the aid of Android's Text To Speech Engine. Further improvement will enable blind people to make phone calls, send SMS, engage in businesses (even though they are blind)using the africaistalking api(this will be aided by the Google Voice Interaction API).
NOTE: place the camera on a text and tap to hear the TTS read it out.
